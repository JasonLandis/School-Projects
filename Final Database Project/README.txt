Hello!

Here, I will show you how we used our application

We used XAMMP to connect the front-end to the back-end.
When running the XAMMP control pannel, we started the modules' Apache and MySQL.
Clicking on the Admin button for the MySQL module opens phpMyAdmin.
We imported our 'Course_regis.sql' file into phpMyAdmin.
Then, inside XAMMP/htdocs folder, we put the folder labeled 'project' which contains all of our code.

If all above is done correctly, running localhost/project will open the project!
