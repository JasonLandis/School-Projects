# Objectives
 - Sort lists using Bubble, Insertion, and Quick sort algorithms.

# Problem Specification & Input
In this project, you will compare the time performance of the Bubble,
Insertion, and Quick-sort sorting algorithms. As well as Python's built-in
`sort()` function (which is called "Tim-sort"). Your program should produce a ".csv" file
containing the timing information following the format of the example CSV file.
This CSV file can be opened with MS Execl, OpenOffice, Google Sheets, etc. to
create a line graph where the x-axis represents the list size
and the y-axis indicates average execution time in seconds.
Show all sorting algorithms on the same graph. For each algorithm, there should be
6 datapoints: where the list size is 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, and 5000. Each list's
values should range from 1 to the list's length (`random.randint(0, n)`).
To improve accuracy, each datapoint should be the average of 10 executions on
different lists.

Write a one-page report (including the graph) explaining the comparison results.

To improve the visual comphrension of the graph, it is suggested to make both
the x-axis and y-axis logarithmic.

# Additional Requirements
## Coding Standards
You must adhere to all conventions applicable to writing programs. This includes the use of white spaces and indentations for readability, the use of comments to explain the meaning of various methods and attributes, and the conventions for naming classes, variables, method parameters and methods.

## Assignment Submission
 - Develop and submit your project on Codio, or eLearning.

*NOTE*: The penalty for late submissions as stated in the course syllabus will be applied in grading any assignment submitted late.

No assignments may be submitted after 11:59 PM on the day preceding the last day of classes (before the Final Exams week). By this time all work should be completed and submitted.
