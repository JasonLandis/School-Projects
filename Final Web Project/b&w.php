			<p>
				<strong>
				Before developing your own film, it is important to understand the chemical processes that occur during development. To this end, I will give a brief overview of process from start to finish.
				Photographic film is a piece of gelatin coated in a material called silver halide. When you take a picture, the silver halide reacts to the light, creating what is called a latent image. The process of developing film starts with this 'latent image' and ends with a fully visible negative on the piece of film. The film is immersed in different chemicals for a set amount of time, then washed with water and dried. The first chemical, called 'developer', converts the silver halide into visible metallic silver. The parts of the film that have been exposed to light form metallic silver while the parts not exposed to any light do not react with the developer and remain silver halide. After the developer, the film is placed in another chemical called a 'stop bath'. The function of the stop bath is to neutralize any developer left on the film, stopping the development process and making sure too much metallic silver is not formed. Then, the film is placed in a final chemical called 'fixer'. The fixer removes any silver halide left on the image that did not react with the developer. Once the film has been placed in all three chemicals, the development process is finished. The final product is a negative image - an image where the lightest parts appear dark, and the darkest parts appear bright.</strong>

				<p>
					<strong>	
					Black and white processing is simpler than color (C-41) processing. Crucially, the chemicals do not have to be temperature controlled.This makes black and white processing much more straightforward. The essential equipment is as follows (for a more detailed look at the equipment, check the <a href="catalog.html">catalog</a>). And of course, you'll need some film to develop! My preferred black & white film stock is Kodak's Tri-X 400, but I also frequently use Ilford HP5+. As for the chemicals you need, I recommend the Ilford brand versions of all three. Links to those are located in the <a href="catalog.html">catalog</a>.</strong>

					<strong>
					The first step of home developing is often the most difficult. In order to prepare the film for developing, you must take it out of its canister, roll it onto the developing spool, and put it in the developing tank. Sounds easy, right? Here's the catch: you must do this all inside of your changing bag. It is essential that NO LIGHT shines on the film until after it comes out of the stop bath. To accomplish this, you must place your film canister, a can opener, and the developing tank and reels inside of the changing bag and zip it closed. Put your arms through the light-tight sleeves, use the can opener to pry open the film canister, and begin rolling the film onto the spool. Below is a short video of me loading some already-developed film into the tank outside of the changing bag so you can see what you have to do. Note that the film I loaded is not an entire roll; I cut my rolls to store in laminated paper. A roll of 35mm is about six times as long as the strip I loaded.</strong>

								<h2 class="card-title"><strong>The Developer</strong></h2>
								<p class="card-text">
									Once your film has been loaded, it's time to pour in the developer. Open the top of the developing tank and pour in the developer until it is full. The developing tank is specially designed to allow pouring of liquids without exposing the film to light, so this is perfectly safe. Developer is often stored in concentrates; the developer may need to be diluted to function properly. A handy website with dilution ratios and developing times that I like to use is <a href="https://www.digitaltruth.com/devchart.php">The Massive Dev Chart</a> - simply search the film you used and the developer you are using,  and it will give you a precise time to leave the developer in for. It is important to agitate (invert) the developing tank every 30 seconds four times or so to make sure the chemicals are distributed evenly on the film. After you have finished with the developer, you can dump it into the sink - most developers are single use.

									After pouring out the developer, it's time to pour in the stop bath. The same rules used with the developer apply - the mixture may be diluted and time is dependent on the type of stop bath you buy. Normally, it is much shorter than developer. Remember to agitate every 30 seconds. The stop bath can be reused, so if you wish to do so pour your stop bath into a 1000ml amber glass bottle for storage. Amber glass lets in less light than normal glass, which increases the working life of the stop bath. After this step you can expose your film to light if you wish. Then it's time to pour in the fixer. Once again, the same rules apply - dilute, pour, agitate, and then pour out - the fixer can be reused too.

									Finally, you must wash your film thouroughly with water. I leave the developing tank under running water for at least 5 minutes. Washing is important because it increases the longevity of your negatives and makes sure all the chemicals are removed from the film.
									After washing, hang up to dry for a few hours, and your negatives are finished! Once dried, I cut my film and sleeve it in archival sleeves for optimal preservation - those will be included in the catalog as well.

				<h1 class="font-weight-light"><strong>Push/Pull Processing</strong></h1>
				<p>
					<strong>A significant advantage of processing film at home is the ability to 'push' or 'pull' your film. If, after finishing a roll of film, you realized your light meter was set incorrectly, you can simply increase the time you put the film in the developer for. If you have underexposed the photo (made it too dark), you can leave the photo in the developer for longer. This causes the metallic silver to grow more, and brightens the image to compensate for the image being too dark. If you have overexposed(made it too bright), you can do the opposite. More specific instructions for pushing and pulling can be found online at <a href="https://www.digitaltruth.com/devchart.php">The Massive Dev Chart</a> or is sometimes mentioned on bottles of developer.</strong>
