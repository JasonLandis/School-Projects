				<h3 class="font-weight-light"><strong>Differences From Black and White Processing</strong></h3>
				<p>
					<strong>There are a few key differences when it comes to color and black and white film. While color film is also coated in silver halide, the silver halide is coupled to dyes. When the developer causes the silver halide to grow, it also causes the colored dyes to grow. Instead of a stop bath, the C-41 process uses a chemical called 'blix' - a combination of bleach and fixer. The bleach washes away the metallic silver and the fixer washes away the silver halide, leaving only the dyes on the film. The film is then immersed in a stablizing chemical that reduces degradation of the film. Like black and white film, film processed with C-41 chemistry results in a negative image. In addition to the chemical differences, there are also some differences in what you must do to process the film. The most important is that color chemicals must be temperature controlled - the developing tank must be kept at precisely 39 degrees celsius. Even minor variations from this number can cause color or density shifts in your film. Don't worry, though - there is a simple piece of equipment that will fix this issue.</strong>

				<h3 class="font-weight-light"><strong>Equipment</strong></h3>
				<p>
					<strong>The equipment required is very similar to what is needed for black and white processing, with a few key additions. For more details on the equipment(including pictures!), check the <a href="catalog.html">catalog</a>. I have found a sous vide cooker to be absolutely essential for developing color film. Although a bit unorthodox, the sous vide cooker allows you to put your chemicals and developing tank into a container of water that will be kept at a precise temperature by the sous vide cooker. Simply plug in the cooker and set its temperature to 39 celsius and you should be good to go.</strong>

				<p>
					<strong>While black and white processing chemicals come in liquid concentrates, most C-41 chemicals come in powdered form. Within the kit will be instructions on how to mix the chemicals, but most kits involve mixing the powders into heated water, then pouring each of the three chemicals into their own amber glass bottles. All three chemicals are reusable, so C-41 is especially economical. Once you have the necessary equipment, you can often process rolls at a cost of less than $2 per roll!</strong>

                            <p class="card-text">
								The process of loading the film is exactly the same as it is in black and white processing. For a detailed explanation and short video on the topic, see the guide on <a href="b&w.html">Black & White Developing</a>. Once your film has been loaded, place the three chemicals in water that is being heated to 39 degrees celsius by the sous vide cooker. The cooker will have a thermometer built in so you can tell when the water is at the right temperature. It is critical to keep both the developing tank and the chemicals submerged in the bath continuously. Only remove the chemicals or tank when you are pouring the chemicals or agitating the developing tank. Before pouring in your developer, color film must be pre-soaked in hot water. This heats the film to the correct temperature and removes	protective layers to the film to prepare it for processing. Most developing kits call for the film to be soaked in hot water for at least a minute.

							<h2 class="card-title"><strong>Using Chemicals</strong></h2>
							<p class="card-text">
								After the pre-soak, it's now time to pour in the developer. Open the top of the developing tank and pour in the developer until it is full. The developing tank is specially designed to allow pouring of liquids without exposing the film to light, so this is perfectly safe. Once again, the process is very similar to black and white processing. Leave the developing tank in water and only take it out every 30 seconds to agitate. The chemical kit you purchased will have more detailed instructions for exactly how long to leave the film in the developer. Remember, C-41 developer can be reused, so make sure to pour it back into an amber glass bottle for reuse. Then pour in the blix. Again, leave it in the water while inverting every 30 seconds. After this step, you can safely expose the film to light. The stabilizer is the last chemical needed. The stabilizer can be done at room temperature, so no need to leave the developing tank in the water.

                            <p class="card-text">
								Finally, you must wash your film thouroughly with water. I leave the developing tank under running water for at least 5 minutes. Washing is important because it increases the longevity of your negatives and makes sure all the chemicals are removed from the film. After washing, hang up to dry for a few hours, and your negatives are finished! Once dried, I cut my film and sleeve it in archival sleeves for optimal preservation - those will be included in the catalog as well!
