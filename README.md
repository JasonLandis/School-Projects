# School Projects
 
This is a collection of some notable school projects I've worked on during my time in college.

Some of the more notable ones include:

## Regular Expression to NFA  
A project I made in the class Theory Foundations. This is a python program that takes in a regular expression from the user and converts it to an NFA. It then takes in a string from the user and runs it through the NFA and determines if the string is accepted or rejected.

## Minigolf
A group project I was a part of in the class Artificial Intelligence. This is a 2D minigolf game made in Unity that using generational learing to determine the optimal power and angle to hit a golf ball to achieve a hole in one on 18 different maps.

## Final Database Project
A group project I led in the class Database Management Systems. For this project our group made a Western Michigan University themed website that allows students to register for an account and then register for classes.

## Other projects
The other projects listed are some smaller, but still memorable projects I've worked on in my time at Western Michigan University
